<b>Civil engineering </b>is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, 
and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, 
bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and 
railways.<br>
Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second
-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military
engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal 
through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.

<h4><b>THE EVOLUTION OF INNOVATION IN CIVIL ENGINEERING</b></h4>
<b>LOWERED ROMAN ARCH</b>
<p>Arches have existed for 4,000 years as structural elements, but it was the Roman engineers who were the first to make
efficient use of their resistant properties. They realised it was not necessary to cover a whole space at once and 
divided the arch into several smaller sections, flattening the shape to create a lowered arch and repeat it at intervals
to create stronger supports that could cross long spans. Indeed, the arch became one of the elements that defines the
Roman architectural style.</p>

<b>CONCRETE</b>
Dome of the Pantheon in Rome <br>
<p>The Romans were the first to make and use a concrete (opus caementicium) consisting of a mixture of gravel with lime,
    
 sand and water. Far from resembling modern-day concretes, they offered a highly valuable characteristic if they added 
 volcanic earth to the mixture in the right proportions: the mix could harden under water.</p>
 

 <b>FLOATING BRIDGES</b>

<p>In many respects, Roman engineering is synonymous for military engineering. Floating bridges (pontoons) were mostly
designed and constructed during wartime, and were a speciality of Julius Caesar. In 55 CB he built a 400-metre-long
pontoon to cross the river Rhine. The construction of a floating bridge without diverting the flow of the river is 
very difficult, and it needs to be done quickly and accurately.</p>
