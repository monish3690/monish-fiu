<p>Most engineering programs start with general courses in Sciences, and then migrate to specialized courses
for the disciplines. While these courses are indeed foundational for many engineering disciplines, they 
can be treated as application domains (as is evidenced from the fact that most sciences and Engineering 
disciplines heavily use computing now). Hence, the B.Tech. (CSE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing
oriented courses first, and allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better 
suited for a CSE program, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer applications and
possibilities of using computing in these subjects.</p><br>
       <h4> Overall objective of the B.Tech.(CSE) program is to improve the following attributes in students:</h4>
  <br><p>
1.Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing.<br>
2.Understanding of computing at different levels of abstraction including circuits and computer architecture, 
operating systems, algorithms and applications.<br>
3.Ability to adapt established models, techniques, algorithms, data structures, etc. for efficiently solving new problems.<br>
4.Ability to design, implement, and evaluate computer based system or application to meet the desired needs using modern
 tools and methodologies.<br>
5.Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.<br>
6.An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.<br>
7.Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience.<br>
8.Ability to self learn and engage in life-long learning too.<br>
9.Understanding and ability to use advanced techniques and tools in different areas of computing.<br>
10.Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects.<br>
11Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if desired).<br>
12.An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal and environmental context.</p><br>

<p>With this approach, the B.Tech. (CSE) program can be divided broadly in two halves. The first half focuses
on building the foundations, and is highly structured. The second part is for developing the skills and
knowledge of the students in various topics â€“ computing and application domains. This part also provides
limited specializations, and different students may follow different paths and take different set of
courses in it.</p>
